 * \brief Contains utility functions for performing the fast fourier transform and its inverse.
 *
 * It uses the FFTW3 library to perform the transforms.  For better performance, the functions temporarily change the size of the input vector by padding it with zeros to a size that can be expressed as a product of small primes, that is 2^x * 3^y * 5^z.
